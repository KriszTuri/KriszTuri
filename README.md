## Hi there, I'm Krisz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior software developer, always hungry for experience and new knowledge, with a dash of creativity and a passion for technology. 
I worked as a web developer previously, hence why I enjoy working with React and TypeScript the most. 
One of my dearest dream is to create a unique visual novel some time in the future. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Project Greenhouse](https://github.com/KriszTuri/project-greenhouse)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
